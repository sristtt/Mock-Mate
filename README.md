## The Walkthrough Timeline

Follow the journey of an aspiring candidate using MockMate to master their next interview.

### Phase 1: Preparation (Context is Key)
Before jumping into a seat, you need to define your targets. MockMate allows you to create specialized practice sessions based on specific job roles and company cultures.

### Phase 2: Practice (The Arena)
Practice makes perfect. Choose between HR-style behavioral rounds, session-specific technical drills, the high-intensity **Live Interview** mode, or the real-time **Live Coding Environment**.

- **Live Coding Mode**: A premium, dual-pane IDE experience powered by Monaco Editor. Synchronize your code in real-time natively through WebSockets across multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++) while maintaining tightly integrated, split-screen video feeds to simulate an authentic technical pair-programming interview!
